 * to be able to produce required objects of HTMLButton and WindowsButton*/

 * Use central point of decisionâ€”like a FactoryRegistry to provide correct concrete factory based on input
 * This way, the client would only need to know about the abstract layer of Factory and not the specific concrete subclass of Factory*/

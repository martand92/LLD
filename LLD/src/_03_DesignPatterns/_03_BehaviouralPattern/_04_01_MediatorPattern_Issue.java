/*
 * Issues :
 * 
 * The Sender directly calls the displayMessage method of the Receiver, leading
 * to a tight coupling between these two classes. If additional receivers are
 * introduced, the Sender would need to handle the logic of deciding which
 * receiver to communicate with
 * 
 * 
 * Any change in the communication logic (e.g., logging, transformations, or
 * additional coordination) would require modifying the Sender class. This
 * violates the Open/Closed Principle, as the Sender class needs to be changed
 * for any new communication requirements
 * 
 * 
 * Without a Mediator, introducing multiple receivers or additional senders
 * increases the complexity of managing the communication flow. For example, if
 * you need to broadcast a message to multiple receivers, you would have to
 * modify the Sender to handle a collection of receivers
 * 
 * 
 * The lack of a Mediator means thereâ€™s no single place to manage or coordinate
 * the communication between Sender and Receiver. This can lead to scattered
 * logic and duplication.
